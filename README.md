# HALP
Enterprise-style home lab for building, testing, and showcasing skills.
HALP ‚Äì Home Lab for Advanced Networking & DevOps

HALP is a personal home lab project designed to simulate enterprise-style network environments. This lab is a playground for testing, learning, and showcasing skills in DevOps, networking, virtualization, and cloud deployment.

üèóÔ∏è Project Goals

This lab aligns with my DevOps training plan and is designed to develop hands-on expertise in:

Network engineering

Virtualization and server management

Cloud infrastructure management and deployments

Monitoring and automation

Containerization and CI/CD

MLOps

Create a demonstrable portfolio of my skills.

‚úÖ Week 1 Wins

Network Diagram: Initial visual plan of the lab infrastructure (Version 1) uploaded. This serves as the blueprint for all lab configurations.

Proxmox VE Installed: Both mini PCs are ready for virtual machines, forming the backbone of the lab environment.

Hypervisor Access: Full access to create, manage, and interconnect VMs directly on the network.

These achievements mark the first step in building practical skills in networking, virtualization, and lab management.


‚úÖ **Week 2 Wins**
- Configured Cisco router and switch with VLANs for mini PCs.  
- Replaced old AP with TP-Link Bravo Echo 6500 to solve PoE and double NAT issues.  
- Troubleshot Cisco + TP-Link compatibility quirks, verified PCs stayed functional.  
- Backed up all configs and pushed encrypted version to GitHub.  
- Learned the importance of device compatibility, subnet stability, and simplifying SSIDs.

‚úÖ **Week 3 Wins**
- Isolated IoT devices from the internal network, verified segmentation with pings.  
- Hardened network by disabling unnecessary ping/discovery responses.  
- Configured VPN server + TunnelBlick client with cert-based auth (still testing external access).  
- Deployed first Windows Server VM, resolved driver/boot order issues, and set DNS/DHCP properly.  
- Reinforced lessons in persistence, troubleshooting, and the importance of details.
